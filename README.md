# multithreaded_programming

In this assignment you will apply the principles of multi-threaded programming.
You will modify a single threaded Rust program provided to you that processes data using the Map-Reduce programming model to create a multi-threaded version.
To see all requirements go to [requirements.md](/requirements.md).

To run and compile:
1. In terminal type "make [enter]"
2. Update numbers in makefile to get different partitions.
or
1. Compile main.rs using "rustc main.rs"
2. Run main using "./main num_partitions num_elements"
